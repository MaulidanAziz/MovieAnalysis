# MovieAnalysis

In this project, I will analyze multiple reviews from rotten tomatoes. First, I will gather raw data from multiple
movie reviews on Rotten tomatoes. Then those data will be pre-processed before being split into training and testing
set. The data will be split into 80:20 and 90:10 scenarios and will be tested with Na√Øve bayes, Logistic Regression,
and SVM classifier. Then there will be a method comparison and after that there will be a hyperparameter tuning stage
to find out does tuning affect the performance or not. The stages of the project are shown below
